## Description

This is a single channel model file that was originally part of a [published model on the ModelDB website](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=147460).


The file [147460\_AXNODE.mod](147460_AXNODE_icgNA2.mod) was extrated from [the ModelDB repository](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=147460), and committed as 147460\_AXNODE\_icgNA2.mod.

The current version of the file was modified slighly for automatic evaluation by the [icg-nrn-sim](https://github.com/icgenealogy/icg-nrn-sim) tool. To find the original please check the git history.

Since the original channel model *[147460\_AXNODE.mod](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=147460)* contained several ionic currents, for the derived channel *147460\_AXNODE\_icgNA2.mod* we deactivated all currents except for one single remaining current.
